A track record of projects completed on time – you are a flawless executor, not a procrastinator. You find satisfaction in a job well done and want to solve head-scratching challenges. Experience with all phases of the software development life cycle, best practices, and Agile software development. Experience using Django. Solid OOP and software design knowledge – you should know how to create software that’s extensible, reusable, and meets desired architectural objectives. Strong familiarity with web server technologies including Nginx, Apache, and J2EE. Experience with Java or Ruby, and the willingness to learn new technologies (experience with other object-oriented languages is okay too, but our code is Java, Ruby, and Scala, so you should be able to get up-to-speed on at least one of them quickly. Establish backend software engineer best practices. Work autonomously, are excited by new technologies, and will never back down from the challenges of scale. Experience with Linux/Unix and scripting languages like Python, Perl, shell scripting, etc. Knowledge of database systems and NoSQL databases such as DynamoDB. Experience deploying machine learning models is a plus.\"\n",
