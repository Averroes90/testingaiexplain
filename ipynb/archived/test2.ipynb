       "  'content': 'Shortly after my transition to the process engineer position with Philip Morris, I was charged with leading a make-shift team composed of machine operators, senior maintenance engineers and technicians for the purpose of improving one of our underperforming key performance indicators; tobacco waste. \\nI began by working on identifying the major loss contributors and areas for improvement and creating an action plan with targets for the next three months.  Over the course of the subsequent weekly team meetings I started perceiving that some of the team members were more concerned about their routine tasks and not fully invested in the project and were not completing their assigned tasks. To address this shortcoming, I redistributed the tasks across the team members who were more active participants and myself. We struggled to keep up, especially given technical knowledge gaps in some areas. \\nAt the end of the month after lots of hard work the new results came in, to my disappointment there was no significant improvement. Shortly thereafter, my supervisor called me for a meeting to discuss the progress and results. He asked about the latest updates and commended all the extra efforts and commitment we have been putting in. He then proceeded to criticize of my leadership approach. Hi highlighted my inability to get all the team members fully engaged in the project as a major weakness. He said that my career progress thus far was due to my analytical rigor and hard skills and what he perceived to be as a potential for growth and explained that in order to progress further I have to address this inadequacy. Finally he noted his expectation for better results for the following month and offered to coach me throughout.\\nAs I received the first negative feedback in my career, I battled feelings of hopelessness and ineptitude. And for the rest of the day, I just sat at my desk to reflect on what had transpired.\\nThe following morning, I woke up determined to change my mind set. After difficult challenge of fully accepting an embracing the criticism, it just seemed clear to me what I needed to do. I set weekly meeting with my manager for coaching and performance review. I subsequently signed up for a couple of internal trainings on leadership and assertiveness. \\nI held individual meetings with each for the project team members, I thanked them for their contributions and discussed the unsatisfactory results with them. After I asked them for individual feedback, I made sure to covey my respect and appreciation for their immense experience and sonority and politely shared my concern over their lack of engagement. I then proceeded to explain the financial implications of our increased tobacco waste in order to convey a more relatable picture of the gravity of the situation. On the following team meeting I threw my originally individually developed action plan and worked with the team to create a new one with individual targets for each member.\\nAfter slightly improved results in the following month I made sure to recognize individual achievements in the presence of senior management. As we all picked up the pace we were finally able to hit an all-time affiliate record for tobacco yield.\\nI can hardly articulate the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt after having overcome my first serious professional obstacle. This experience was in fact what first triggered for my interest to pursue MBA education.',\n",

       "  'content': 'Given my somewhat unusual personal and professional background, I believe that  I will be able \\nto bring a unique perspective  and value  to the diverse Fuqua culture . \\nMy earliest encounter with entrepreneurship came at a young age. I was 9 when a kindergarten \\nmy parents founded opened its doors to preschoolers from around the neighborhood. Under my \\nmother’s management, it grew rapidly into a full -fledged school that provides high quality \\neducation at affordable costs to around 500 students.  A true team project, the whole family \\ncontributed in one way or another to  its rapid growth and success. Tutoring there during college, \\nworking there briefly after graduation, and as a member of the decision making circle  \\nthroughout, I  received valuable knowledge  about  business dynamics at medium to small sized \\nbusinesses , and about entrepreneurship in Jordan.  \\nI hope to share  and build upon  my experiences by starting a Fuqua club focused on \\nentrepreneurship and business in the Middle E ast. I believe this would pr ovide distinctive insight \\nfor my prospective colleagues into an area that, although distinct in many respects, is somewhat \\nless explored than markets like Asia or Latin America . I am also excited about the prospect of \\norganizing a trek  for my prospective Fuqua colleagues to Jordan , which  is at the center of the \\nArab World technology start -up revolution  and witnessing a unique technological transformation.  \\nA visit to one of the world’s new seven wonders, Petra , would just be the cherry on top.  \\nSince childho od, I was always very passionate about the technology industry, assembling my \\nfirst personal computer at 7, developing android applications, and studying mechatronics \\nengineering. Anxiously following all news about a new device or i nnovation, over the year s I was \\nable to develop instincts  about technology trends. I found myself on many occasions able to \\npredict the success or lack thereof of new tech ventures. A passionate techie, I hope to enrich \\nmy knowledge at , and suggest topics for , the High Tech 101 &  201 Sessions  and advocate for \\nmy viewpoints through the weekly “tech talks” at the High Technology club.  \\nProfessionally, I was fortunate to join the Jordanian Philip Morris International affiliate shortly \\nafter it was acquired from an aging local manufac turer. I was part of the “new blood” tasked with \\nelevating the previously local company to the required corporate standard, no easy task. As part \\nof a small team in a rapidly changing environment my limits were constantly expanding. My \\nlearning curve was a stronomical across diverse areas from operations and projects \\nmanagement to cross -functional projects involvin g sales, marketing and finance. It was a \\nchaotic scene in which e veryone was involved in everything and I loved it.  I guess i n many ways \\nit resemb led a start -up. I intend to utilize my  cross -functional experience to help my fellow study \\ngroup partners integrate knowledge gained from different areas into one big picture. \\nFurthermore, I plan to leverage my cross -cultural communication skill set to enhance the \\nharmony among my diverse section.  \\nThrough the years, I  have cultivated  diverse global experience . I grew  up in the UAE and have \\nlived there again as an adult, travell ed across the Middle Ea st, Europe and to the United States . \\nMost recently,  I started a one -year work assignment in Izmir, Turkey  within an international \\nFortune 500 company . I am particularly looking forward to taking a leadership role within the \\nFuqua international business clu b. Through m y exposure to the organizational challenges and \\ndynamics at one of the largest and most diverse Philip Morris International affiliates I will be able \\nto share, with my fellow future business leaders at Fuqua,  my firsthand account of the \\nchallenges and opportunities of working in a truly international business and what I have \\nperceived to be the best ways to overcome all cultural and linguistic barriers. I am also looking \\nforward to participat ing in the GATE pr ogram to acquire additional exposure into new areas, \\nparticularly Latin America and South East Asia.  \\nFuqua is the perfect fit for me, in terms of both p rofessional and personal  growth. I am eager to \\nutilize the plethora of gateways and opportunities that F uqua offers to contribute to the \\ncommunity. Whether through the initial community service projects, the world renowned Net \\nImpact Club or Habitat for Humanity of Durham, I am brimming with excitement at the prospect \\nof contributing substantially to Fuqua’s  social entrepreneurship efforts.   \\nFinally , I am keen to bring my football (soccer) and fencing skills to the MBA games and to \\nintroducing  my home country’s traditional dish , Mansaf at one of the a round the world dinner s. A \\nvoracious reader and new s-junkie I am also interested in revamping the weekly newsletter.  \\n \\n ',\n",

My \\nparents were adamant about education and strove to provide the best quality of education their means \\nallowed. Against my parents’ advice, who wanted me to study medicine, I elected to pursue my passion \\nfor technology and earn a degree in Mechatronics Engineering.  \\nShortly after beginning college at the University of Jordan I realized that the school was in a state of rapid \\ndecline. Classes were extremel y overcrowded, the aging infrastructure was crumbling, and the previously \\nWestern educated faculty was being replaced by a locally educated, less -qualified cohort. Despite being \\nthe most selective school in the country and thereby having some of the most h ighly qualified students, \\nclass failure rates were upwards of 60%. Students often repeated courses five or six times.  \\nI began searching for opportunities to transfer to a university abroad.  Unfortunately, I could not financially \\nafford it.  Meanwhile,  as I felt consumed by the stigma of failure, I did not want to go back to my family and \\ndisappoint them . I felt increasingly isolated  and I did not know where to turn for guidance.  \\nLooking back, I should have asked  my loved ones for help and put in the extra effort to adapt and do \\nwhatever was necessary to  overcome this challenge. Instead, when life threw me my first serious curve \\nball, it knocked me out. I lost all motivation, I stopped going to classes, my self-esteem  took a big hit, and \\nI descended towards rock bottom.  My former academic success was all but forgotten and I slowly settled \\nfor doing the bare minimum and becoming an average student, quite literally; I finished one semester late \\nand around  the fiftieth percentile of my class.  \\nFortunately, things improved after I started at Philip Morris International.

Over the course of the subsequent weekly team meetings I started perceiving that some of the team members were more concerned about their routine tasks and not fully invested in the project and were not completing their assigned tasks. To address this shortcoming, I redistributed the tasks across the team members who were more active participants and myself. We struggled to keep up, especially given technical knowledge gaps in some areas. \\nAt the end of the month after lots of hard work the new results came in, to my disappointment there was no significant improvement. Shortly thereafter, my supervisor called me for a meeting to discuss the progress and results. He asked about the latest updates and commended all the extra efforts and commitment we have been putting in. He then proceeded to criticize of my leadership approach. Hi highlighted my inability to get all the team members fully engaged in the project as a major weakness. He said that my career progress thus far was due to my analytical rigor and hard skills and what he perceived to be as a potential for growth and explained that in order to progress further I have to address this inadequacy. Finally he noted his expectation for better results for the following month and offered to coach me throughout.\\nAs I received the first negative feedback in my career, I battled feelings of hopelessness and ineptitude. And for the rest of the day, I just sat at my desk to reflect on what had transpired.\\nThe following morning, I woke up determined to change my mind set. After difficult challenge of fully accepting an embracing the criticism, it just seemed clear to me what I needed to do. I set weekly meeting with my manager for coaching and performance review. I subsequently signed up for a couple of internal trainings on leadership and assertiveness. \\nI held individual meetings with each for the project team members, I thanked them for their contributions and discussed the unsatisfactory results with them. After I asked them for individual feedback, I made sure to covey my respect and appreciation for their immense experience and sonority and politely shared my concern over their lack of engagement. I then proceeded to explain the financial implications of our increased tobacco waste in order to convey a more relatable picture of the gravity of the situation. On the following team meeting I threw my originally individually developed action plan and worked with the team to create a new one with individual targets for each member.\\nAfter slightly improved results in the following month I made sure to recognize individual achievements in the presence of senior management. As we all picked up the pace we were finally able to hit an all-time affiliate record for tobacco yield.\\nI can hardly articulate the sense of pride and accomplishment I felt after having overcome my first serious professional obstacle.

I was 9 when a kindergarten \\nmy parents founded opened its doors to preschoolers from around the neighborhood. Under my \\nmother’s management, it grew rapidly into a full -fledged school that provides high quality \\neducation at affordable costs to around 500 students.  A true team project, the whole family \\ncontributed in one way or another to  its rapid growth and success.

Anxiously following all news about a new device or i nnovation, over the year s I was \\nable to develop instincts  about technology trends.

I intend to utilize my  cross -functional experience to help my fellow study \\ngroup partners integrate knowledge gained from different areas into one big picture. \\nFurthermore, I plan to leverage my cross -cultural communication skill set to enhance the \\nharmony among my diverse section.  \\nThrough the years, I  have cultivated  diverse global experience .
